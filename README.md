# fraud-credit-card-detection
A project that addresses a challenge many financial institutions face: Credit Card Fraud Detection. With the digital economy growing rapidly, online transactions are becoming the norm. Unfortunately, this has also made fraudsters more sophisticated, leading to significant financial losses and eroding customer trust.

## Why is this project important?

In 2023 alone, credit card fraud accounted for billions in losses globally.
The average financial institution detects only a fraction of fraudulent transactions, while others slip through unnoticed.
Our goal in this project is to design a machine learning system that identifies fraudulent transactions with high accuracy and efficiency, focusing on minimizing false negatives, where fraud goes undetected.
